### Exam Helper
### #Assignment

You are asked to submit an application that shows the list of your final exams (initially stored in a local database - SQLite) using Android Studio.
<br />

### Project Requirements: 

- When the user presses on an exam (item), the app should display, in a different page, a corresponding Webview (online website) to study from (i.e: Mobile Computing: Official ([Docs](https://ionicframework.com/)) of Android/ Ionic).
- No need for CRUD operations - just read from the database. 
- The exams should be added from the code and then commented (the same way we did in class).
